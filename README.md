# Umbrafex
Umbrafex is a psychological horror anthology where every choice leads to a different nightmare. Featuring multiple interconnected stories, the game’s main narrative unfolds in the shadowy depths of America’s National Parks—where untouched wilderness hides something far more sinister than the natural world.
